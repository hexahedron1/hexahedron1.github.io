    This seed has an <b>oil puzzle</b> in the mines which, when completed, gives you the wand shown above<br>
    <b>Ping pong path</b> is very useful if you have a luminous drill, especially if you also have a <b>fast wand</b> and <b>add mana</b><br>
    Conveniently, in the mines there's a wand with firebolts that let you easily break the wooden wall <b>without damaging to the environment</b><br>
    This seed also has a <b>chaos die</b> in a chest in <b>collapsed mines</b>
    <br><b>2047099437</b><br>
    This seed sometimes randomly creates <b>gold nuggets</b> on spawn. This may be a treasure chest being somehow opened and upwarping its contents<br>
