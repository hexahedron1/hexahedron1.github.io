    The original website was made in replit and looked very different than this version<br>
    It was completely empty (<label class="highlight">index.html</label> did not even exist) for a few months before being updated to this version<br>
    I always wanted to make a website that resembled a <label class="highlight">TTY/terminal</label> and surprizingly this is a successful attempt at that<br>
    Originally everything was located on the top left to be consitent with a terminal, but for convenience sake it was centered<br>
    The splashes contain <label class="highlight">several easter eggs</label> related to my friend group memes<br>
    There's a <label class="highlight">0.1%</label> chance that you can get <label class="highlight">this splash is very rare</label>.<br>
    <label class="highlight">People who got the splash</label><br>
    Nobody so far...<br>
    <br>
    If you get it legitmately, <label class="highlight">ping</label> me in my discord server or <label class="highlight">DM</label> me with the proof and <label class="highlight">you will be added here</label>.<br>
    <label class="highlight">Convenient splash simulator:</label><br>
    <label id="splash" style="color: rgb(255,255,85);"></label><br>
    <button onclick="document.getElementById('splash').innerHTML = newSplash()">Reroll</button>
