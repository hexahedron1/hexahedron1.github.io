    The original website was made in replit and looked very different than this version<br>
    It was completely empty (<b>index.html</b> did not even exist) for a few months before being updated to this version<br>
    I always wanted to make a website that resembled a <b>TTY/terminal</b> and surprizingly this is a successful attempt at that<br>
    Originally everything was located on the top left to be consitent with a terminal, but for convenience sake it was centered<br>
    The splashes contain <b>several easter eggs</b> related to my friend group memes<br>
    There's a <b>0.1%</b> chance that you can get <b>this splash is very rare</b>.<br>
    <b>People who got the splash</b><br>
    Nobody so far...<br>
    <br>
    If you get it legitmately, <b>ping</b> me in my discord server or <b>DM</b> me with the proof and <b>you will be added here</b>.<br>
    <b>Convenient splash simulator:</b><br>
    <label id="splash" style="color: rgb(255,255,85);"></label><br>
    <button onclick="document.getElementById('splash').innerHTML = newSplash()">Reroll</button><br>
